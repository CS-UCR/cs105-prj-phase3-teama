For phase 1 of our project we plan to implement the web crawler scrapy to extract a dataset.

Porject_p1.ipynb - contains all nba teams , city ,Conference

Porject_p1_2.ipynb - contains all nba player , names hight and position

scrapy1.py - is a web crawler I tried to implement, but couldn't get to work for the time being.
